--In this section I query to look at total cases vs Total deaths in Canada, and orderer the information

Select location, date, total_cases,total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100) AS DeathPercentageFromCovid
From PortfolioProject.dbo.CovidDeaths
Where location like '%Canada%'
order by location,date


-- This query will show countries with highest infection rate compared to population

Select location, population, max(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount,  
	MAX((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentagePopulationInfected
from PortfolioProject.dbo.CovidDeaths
Group by Location, population
order by PercentagePopulationInfected desc

--In the case above, I noticed that there where many null values and also some countries had a percentage of infection higher than 100%
--This meant that I had to make some data cleaning, so I filtered in Excel the few countries that had this problem (Venezuela, Poland, Moroco, Saudi Arabia, etc.)
--I noticed some dirty data, in which population was extremely short (i.e. Venezuela had 480 population in a few cells) making the Max (total_cases/population) 
--extremely high, so I just filtered and replaced the dirty data from these countries
